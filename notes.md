ATProto PLC Utilities

Plan:

- plc backup & snapshot
- plc mirror & syncing
- extras that are helpful to apps building on atproto
  - provide handle based lookup
  - account collection list
  - denormalized did doc details for faster queries
  - `did:web:...` support 
  - clients which fall back to official PLC (or other mirrors for read only)
    - proxy write requests?
  - authnz setup
- provide public read-only mirror with generous rate limits
- provide setups for multiple clouds
- fun data science & graphs
- public stats dashboard and explorer
